## How I Built This Tool

1. **Planning & Design:**
   - Identified core project management needs: task tracking, timeline visualization, project status monitoring, and easy data entry.
   - Designed the structure with separate sheets for Settings, Tasks, Overview, Dashboard, Timeline, and Kanban to keep the workbook organized.
   - Planned dropdown lists for statuses, priorities, and phases to maintain consistency and reduce errors in user inputs.

2. **Data Structure Setup:**
   - Created tables in Excel for Projects and Tasks, ensuring each has all necessary attributes.
   - Used Excel tables and structured references to enable dynamic ranges for dropdown menus and formulas.

3. **Data Validation & Dropdowns:**
   - Implemented dropdown menus for fields such as project name, task priority, status, and phase by linking them to predefined lists on the Settings sheet.
   - Used data validation to restrict inputs and guide users in selecting valid options.

4. **Formulas & Calculations:**
   - Developed formulas to calculate project duration, task counts, completion percentages, and categorize projects into ongoing, past, or upcoming.
   - Used conditional formatting to visually differentiate project statuses and highlight important dates.

5. **Visual Dashboards:**
   - Created overview and dashboard sheets with clear, at-a-glance summaries of projects and tasks.
   - Implemented timeline visualization using cell formatting and date formulas to display project phases across calendar weeks.

6. **Kanban Board Setup:**
   - Structured the Kanban board to dynamically reflect task statuses, enabling users to track progress visually.
   - Linked Kanban columns to task data using Excel formulas or filters.
